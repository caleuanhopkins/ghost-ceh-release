An Edited Release Version of Ghost by caleuanhopkins

## About

Ghost is an amazing blogging platform that's taking the blogging sphere by storm. Ghost is an open source platform, and allows developers to build upon its core to create their own versions of Ghost to use privately.

This repo contains a personally edited edition of Ghost which I (caleuanhopkins) have done to match the wants and needs I wish to have in the Ghost blogging platform. This version is not supported or has any affiliation to the official Ghost Foundation version of Ghost, nor to its development team. This is strictly for personal and experimentation purposes only.
